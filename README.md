# Deathrun-CTSafe-Buttons
This plugin prevents the Counter-Terrorists from activating traps after they finish the map or traps that can be activated through thin walls, bugs on the map etc. By default, CT players are unable to press any buttons on the map, but you can enable them to do so on specific ones, by holding down the "R" button and pressing "G" while at the same time looking at the button. On some maps the button is inside a wall, so in such cases you can hold down "R" and press the button with "E". This is needed for maps that have buttons who must be pressed by CTs in order to continue playing. The files are saved in data/CTSafeButtons/mapname.txt.
